			<h2>Tatooine</h2>
			<p>Tatooine (pronounced /t√¶tu'in/; Jawaese: Tah doo Een e[8]) was a desert world and the first planet in the binary Tatoo star system. It was here that Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn recognized Anakin's potential to become a Jedi and where he introduced him to Obi-Wan Kenobi, his future master and mentor. Tatooine was also the home of Anakin's son, Luke, where he lived until his early adulthood. The planet acquired a bad reputation, often being viewed as the cesspool of the galaxy due to the large number of criminals who could be found there.</p>

		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>Docking Bay 94</h2>
			<p>One of Mos Eisley's 362 docking bays scattered throughout the city, was where the Millennium Falcon waited to rendezvous with Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke Skywalker, R2-D2, and C-3PO and where a notorious meeting between Jabba the Hutt and Han Solo took place about a spice shipment tragedy Solo had never paid back.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-4">
			<h2>The Cantina</h2>
			<p>The Chalmun's Cantina (often called the Mos Eisley Cantina or the Star Wars Cantina) is a fictional bar (cantina) of the Star Wars universe located in the "pirate city" of Mos Eisley on the planet Tatooine. It is the haunt of freight pilots and other dangerous characters of various alien races and contains booths, a bar counter, and some free-standing tables, and sometimes a band of musicians named Figrin D'an and the Modal Nodes.</p>
